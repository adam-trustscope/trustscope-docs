# Gateway vs SDK

TrustScope offers two primary integration methods. Here's how to choose.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Gateway | SDK |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | 15 minutes |
| **Code changes** | 2 lines | Decorators/wrappers |
| **Languages** | Any (HTTP) | Python, Node.js |
| **Capture** | All LLM calls automatically | Selected functions |
| **Custom actions** | No | Yes |
| **Offline support** | No | Yes (batching) |

## Use Gateway When

- You want minimal code changes
- You have existing applications
- You use multiple LLM providers
- You want automatic capture of everything

## Use SDK When

- You want fine-grained control
- You need to capture custom actions (tool calls, decisions)
- You're building a new application
- You need offline/batched logging

## Combining Both

You can use both Gateway and SDK together for comprehensive coverage:

```python
# Gateway for LLM calls
client = OpenAI(base_url="https://gateway.trustscope.ai/v1", ...)

# SDK for custom actions
@ts.observe(agent_id="my-agent")
def my_agent():
    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)  # Captured by Gateway
    ts.log_action("business_logic", {...})          # Captured by SDK
```
