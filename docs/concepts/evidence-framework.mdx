# Evidence Framework

TrustScope generates evidence. We do not determine compliance. Courts, auditors, and regulators interpret the evidence — we generate it.

**What we say:** "Here is cryptographic proof that 5 governance checks ran on this action."

**What we don't say:** "Your system is compliant."

---

## Evidence Hierarchy

| Level | Type | Assurance | How It Works |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | Traditional | Trust the logger | JSON logs, timestamps |
| **Level 2** | Signed | Cryptographic integrity | Ed25519 signatures + SHA-256 hash chain |
| **Level 3** | Timestamped | Independent temporal proof | + OpenTimestamps Bitcoin anchoring |
| **Level 4** | ZKP-Proven | Mathematical proof without data | + Zero-knowledge proofs |

Each level builds on the previous. Level 4 (ZKP) is the highest assurance and resolves the compliance paradox.

## Evidence Types

### Governance Traces (All Tiers)

Every agent action captured with:
- agent_id, action_type, timestamp
- input/output (if permitted)
- detection results
- policy evaluations
- session context

### Detection Events (All Tiers)

Every detection engine result:
- engine_name
- result (pass/fail/alert)
- confidence
- details, timestamp

### Policy Evaluations (Protect+)

Every policy check:
- policy_id
- action evaluated
- result (allow/block/escalate)
- reasoning

### Governance Verification Reports (Govern)

14-layer analysis results:
- per-layer pass/fail
- evidence collected
- overall governance score
- negligence indicators

### Evidence Packs (Govern)

Framework-mapped evidence bundles containing:
- selected traces
- detection events
- policy evaluations
- governance reports
- hash chain verification
- timestamp proofs
- AI-generated control narratives

### ZK Proofs (Govern)

Zero-knowledge proofs over committed evidence:
- circuit type
- public inputs
- proof data
- verification status

## 6-Status Evidence Model

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Evidence Ready** | TrustScope generates automatically |
| **Conditional** | Available IF traffic routed through TrustScope |
| **Integration Required** | Need external integration (Okta, Jira) |
| **Customer Provided** | Customer owns (HR policies, training) |
| **Organizational Exclusion** | HR/culture control, not software |
| **Out of Scope** | Not our domain (bias testing, training data) |

## Evidence Trust Model

### Who Trusts What

| Audience | Minimum Level | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Internal team | Level 1 | Trust their own systems |
| External auditor | Level 2 | Need tamper-evidence |
| Regulator | Level 3 | Need independent temporal proof |
| Opposing counsel | Level 3 | Need non-repudiation |
| Privacy-restricted | Level 4 | Cannot see underlying data |
| Classified/CUI | Level 4 | Cannot share operational details |

### The Compliance Paradox

Some regulations create a paradox: proving compliance requires sharing the data you're protecting.

| Regulation | Paradox | ZKP Resolution |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| HIPAA | Proving PHI handling requires sharing PHI | ZK proof of PHI scan results without PHI |
| AML/BSA | Proving monitoring reveals monitoring patterns | ZK proof of coverage without patterns |
| FERPA | Proving student data protection requires data | ZK proof of handling without records |
| Classified | Proving compliance requires sharing classified info | ZK proof of compliance without details |

## Compliance Escrow

Single evidence dataset → multiple audience views:

| Audience | Sees | Redacted | ZK-Proven |
|----------|------|----------|-----------|
| Internal | Everything | Nothing | Optional |
| Auditor | Most artifacts | Trade secrets | Redacted properties |
| Regulator | Framework-specific | Operational details | Compliance properties |
| Insurer | Fleet aggregates | All individual data | Fleet compliance |
| Board | Summary + trends | All operational detail | Improvement trends |

All views provably derive from the same Merkle root → same dataset → provably consistent.

---

## Federated Evidence

Multiple organizations contribute ZK proofs → industry-level compliance statistics.

**Requirements:**
- Minimum K=5 participants (k-anonymity)
- Individual ZK proof verification
- Pedersen homomorphic aggregation

**Output:** "Across N organizations, metric X averaged Y" — proved mathematically, no individual data revealed.

---

## Cryptographic Components

### Signatures

**Ed25519** for all signed evidence:
- TrustScope-signed at Enforce tier
- Customer BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) at Govern tier

### Hash Chain

**SHA-256** hash chain for tamper evidence:
- Each trace includes hash of previous trace
- Chain verification detects gaps or modifications
- Anti-rollback protection

### Timestamping

**OpenTimestamps** Bitcoin anchoring (Govern only):
- Independent third-party temporal proof
- Bitcoin blockchain as timestamp authority
- Merkle tree aggregation for efficiency

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**10 Noir circuits** via Sindri proving service:

| Circuit | Proves |
|---------|--------|
| governance_coverage | Required checks executed |
| pii_compliance | PII scan ran, no violations |
| cost_budget | Costs within budget |
| policy_enforcement | Policies evaluated correctly |
| detection_coverage | Required engines executed |
| hash_chain_integrity | Chain intact |
| agent_identity | Correct fingerprint |
| time_bounds | Within period |
| aggregate_stats | Stats without data |
| threshold_proof | Threshold met |

**Cost:** $0.21 per full audit (all 10 circuits)
