# Detections

TrustScope runs real-time detection engines on all AI traffic to identify threats and anomalies.

## Detection Categories

### Security Detections
- **Prompt Injection** - Attempts to override system instructions
- **Jailbreak** - Attempts to bypass safety measures
- **Data Exfiltration** - Unauthorized data access attempts

### Privacy Detections
- **PII** - Names, emails, SSNs, credit cards
- **PHI** - Health information (HIPAA)
- **Secrets** - API keys, passwords, tokens

### Behavioral Detections
- **Agent Drift** - Behavior differs from baseline
- **Anomaly** - Unusual patterns detected
- **Rate Anomaly** - Abnormal request volume

## Detection Response

When a detection fires:

```json
{
  "trace_id": "tr_abc123",
  "detections": [
    {
      "type": "pii",
      "subtype": "ssn",
      "confidence": 0.98,
      "location": "input.messages[0].content",
      "action": "blocked"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuring Detections

In the dashboard, configure:
- Which detections to enable
- Sensitivity thresholds
- Actions (log, alert, block)
- Exceptions and allowlists
