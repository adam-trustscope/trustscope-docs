# Policies

Policies define rules that govern AI agent behavior. TrustScope enforces these in real-time.

## Policy Types

### Content Policies
- `no-pii` - Block personally identifiable information
- `no-profanity` - Filter inappropriate language
- `content-filter` - General harmful content detection

### Cost Policies
- `cost-limit-{amount}` - Max cost per request
- `token-limit-{count}` - Max tokens per request
- `daily-budget-{amount}` - Daily spending cap

### Business Logic Policies
- `business-hours` - Only allow during work hours
- `approved-tools-only` - Restrict tool usage
- `max-refund-{amount}` - Limit financial actions

## Using Policies

### SDK Enforcement

```python
@ts.enforce(
    agent_id="refund-bot",
    policies=["max-refund-1000", "no-pii"]
)
def process_refund(customer_id: str, amount: float):
    # Only executes if policies pass
    ...
```

### Gateway Policies

Configure default policies in the dashboard that apply to all Gateway traffic.

## Policy Violations

When a policy is violated:
1. Action is blocked (configurable)
2. Violation is logged
3. Alert is triggered (optional)
4. Response includes violation details
