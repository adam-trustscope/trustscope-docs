# Sessions

A **session** groups related AI interactions together, providing context and traceability.

## What is a Session?

A session might represent:
- A user conversation from start to finish
- A multi-step workflow execution
- A batch processing job
- Any logical unit of work

## Creating Sessions

### Python SDK

```python
with ts.session(agent_id="my-agent", session_id="user_123") as session:
    result1 = process_query("What's my order status?")
    result2 = process_query("Can you update my address?")
```

### Gateway (via Headers)

```python
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://gateway.trustscope.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "X-TrustScope-Key": "ts_live_xxx",
        "X-TrustScope-Session-Id": "user_123"
    }
)
```

## Session Benefits

1. **Traceability** - See all actions in a conversation
2. **Context** - Understand user intent across messages
3. **Analytics** - Measure session-level metrics
4. **Compliance** - Export complete interaction history
