# Agents

In TrustScope, an **agent** represents a distinct AI entity that performs tasks.

## What is an Agent?

An agent can be:
- A chatbot handling customer support
- An autonomous coding assistant
- A multi-step workflow orchestrator
- Any AI system that makes decisions

## Agent Identity

Every agent has a unique `agent_id` that identifies it across all traces:

```python
@ts.observe(agent_id="customer-support-bot")
def handle_customer_query(query: str):
    ...
```

## Agent DNA

TrustScope automatically builds a behavioral "DNA" profile for each agent. This genetic fingerprint captures:

| Strand | What It Captures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Static** | Model, system prompt hash, tools enabled |
| **Functional** | API access, file operations, cost limits |
| **Dynamic** | Response patterns, tool usage, error rates |

Agent DNA enables:
- **Trust Scoring** — Quantified reliability (0-100)
- **Drift Detection** — Alerts when behavior deviates from baseline
- **Freeze/Unfreeze** — Lock agent configuration (Enforce+)
- **Verification** — Cryptographic attestation (Govern)

```python
# Get agent DNA profile
agent = ts.agents.get("customer-support-bot")
print(agent.trust_score)  # 87
print(agent.drift_score)  # 0.12

# Freeze agent to prevent changes
ts.agents.freeze("customer-support-bot")
```

For complete DNA documentation, see [Agent DNA](/docs/concepts/agent-dna).

## Multi-Agent Systems

For systems with multiple agents, each should have a distinct ID:

```python
@ts.observe(agent_id="researcher")
def research_agent():
    ...

@ts.observe(agent_id="writer")
def writer_agent():
    ...
```

TrustScope tracks interactions between agents in the same session.
