# Agents

In TrustScope, an **agent** represents a distinct AI entity that performs tasks.

## What is an Agent?

An agent can be:
- A chatbot handling customer support
- An autonomous coding assistant
- A multi-step workflow orchestrator
- Any AI system that makes decisions

## Agent Identity

Every agent has a unique `agent_id` that identifies it across all traces:

```python
@ts.observe(agent_id="customer-support-bot")
def handle_customer_query(query: str):
    ...
```

## Agent Fingerprinting

TrustScope automatically builds a behavioral fingerprint for each agent based on:
- System prompts used
- Tools available
- Response patterns
- Model preferences

This fingerprint enables:
- **Drift detection** - Alert when agent behavior changes
- **Identity verification** - Ensure the right agent is running
- **Anomaly detection** - Spot unusual activity

## Multi-Agent Systems

For systems with multiple agents, each should have a distinct ID:

```python
@ts.observe(agent_id="researcher")
def research_agent():
    ...

@ts.observe(agent_id="writer")
def writer_agent():
    ...
```

TrustScope tracks interactions between agents in the same session.
