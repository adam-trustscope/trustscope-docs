# EU AI Act Compliance

The EU AI Act establishes regulatory requirements for AI systems. TrustScope helps organizations meet these requirements.

## Risk Classification

The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk level:

| Risk Level | Examples | Requirements |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Unacceptable** | Social scoring, real-time biometric | Prohibited |
| **High-Risk** | HR, credit scoring, law enforcement | Full compliance |
| **Limited Risk** | Chatbots, AI-generated content | Transparency |
| **Minimal Risk** | Spam filters, games | None |
