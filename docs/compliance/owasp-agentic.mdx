# OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications

The OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026) identifies critical security risks in AI agent systems. TrustScope provides 20 detection engines and multiple governance controls mapped to each category.

## ASI01: Agent Goal Hijack

**Risk:** Attackers manipulate agent objectives, task selection, or decision pathways through prompt injection, deceptive tool outputs, or poisoned data.

**Active Detections:**
- **Prompt Injection** — 40+ patterns across 8 languages, confidence scoring (Enforce+)
- **Jailbreak Detector** — 35+ patterns with known jailbreak database (DAN, STAN, etc.) (Enforce+)
- **Semantic Firewall** — LiteLLM embedding similarity for hidden instruction detection (Enforce+)
- **Oscillation Detection** — A-B-A-B goal confusion pattern detection (All tiers)
- **Hallucination Detection** — 3-layer pipeline: ground truth, behavioral anomaly, LLM verification (Enforce+)
- **Reasoning Drift** — LLM-powered logical fallacy and goal drift detection (Enforce+)

**Controls:**
- Agent DNA behavioral baselines (Enforce+)
- Approval workflows for high-impact actions (Enforce+)
- Hash Chain tamper-evident audit trail (Govern)

```python
# Automatic detection in Gateway
client = OpenAI(base_url="https://gateway.trustscope.ai/v1", ...)

# If injection detected:
# {
#   "detections": [{
#     "type": "prompt_injection",
#     "confidence": 0.95,
#     "action": "blocked"
#   }]
# }
```

## ASI02: Tool Misuse & Exploitation

**Risk:** Agents invoke tools in unintended or harmful ways, or attackers exploit tool capabilities to execute malicious actions.

**Active Detections:**

**Active Detections:**
- **PII Scanner** — 70 patterns with Luhn, IBAN, and SSN validation (All tiers)
- **Secrets Scanner** — 52 patterns across cloud, AI/ML, payment, and database credentials (Protect+)

## ASI04: Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Risk:** Risks from untrusted or compromised tools, plugins, MCP servers, packages, and dependencies.

**Controls:**
- MCP Server Allowlisting — fail-closed with `auto_block_unknown_tools=True`, SHA256 manifest hashing (Protect+)
- Tool provenance policy — SHA256 tool baselines with tamper detection (Govern)
- Agent DNA tool fingerprinting — capability expansion alerts on new tools (Enforce+)
- Agent Lock — freeze agent behavior, block drift (Enforce+)

```python
@ts.enforce(
    agent_id="support-bot",
    policies=["approved-tools-only", "read-only-database"]
)
def support_agent(query: str):
    ...
```

---

## ASI05: Unexpected Code Execution (RCE)

**Risk:** Agents generate or execute code leading to remote code execution, sandbox escape, or system compromise.

**Active Detections:**
- **Command Firewall** — Blocks shell injection (25 patterns), SQL injection (16 patterns), code execution (24 patterns), and secrets access (32 patterns) (Protect+)
- **Blocked Phrases** — Custom deny-lists for dangerous code patterns (Protect+)

**Controls:**
- Hash Chain tamper-evident audit trail of all execution attempts (Govern)

:::note
Sandbox enforcement is customer responsibility. TrustScope provides monitoring and pattern-based blocking.

## ASI06: Memory & Context Poisoning

**Risk:** Adversaries corrupt agent memory, context, embeddings, or persistent state to influence future reasoning.

**Active Detections:**
- **Token Growth** — Detects context window inflation attacks via percentage growth rate (All tiers)
- **Context Expansion** — Monitors context size anomalies with absolute threshold (50K tokens) and growth rate (1.5x) (All tiers)
- **Ground Truth** — Validates factual claims in responses against tool result data with numeric comparison (Enforce+)

:::note
Content-level memory scanning and RAG poisoning detection are on the roadmap.

## ASI07: Insecure Inter-Agent Communication

**Risk:** Attacks on agent-to-agent communication channels, message integrity, delegation chains, and discovery.

**Active Detections:**
- **A2A Depth** — Configurable max delegation depth with parent chain walk and cycle detection (Enforce+)
- **Semantic Firewall** — Hidden instruction detection in inter-agent messages (Enforce+)

**Controls:**
- Hash Chain message integrity — SHA256 chain with prev_hash linkage (Govern)
- Policy engine chain depth limits (Enforce+)
- A2A session tracking with agent chain recording (Enforce+)

## ASI08: Cascading Failures
