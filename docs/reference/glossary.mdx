# Glossary

Key terms and definitions used in TrustScope.

---

## A

### Agent
An AI system that performs tasks autonomously. In TrustScope, each agent has a unique `agent_id` that identifies it across all traces and sessions.

### Agent Fingerprint
A behavioral profile of an agent based on its system prompt, tools, model preferences, and response patterns. Used for drift detection and identity verification.

### Audit Trail
An immutable, cryptographically-linked sequence of traces that provides evidence of all AI agent activity for compliance and forensics.

---

## B

### Batch
Multiple API calls grouped together in a single request for efficiency. TrustScope supports up to 100 observations per batch.

### Bitcoin Anchoring
Optional feature that anchors trace hashes to the Bitcoin blockchain for tamper-evident, publicly verifiable audit trails.

---

## C

### Chain of Custody
The cryptographic hash chain linking all traces in sequence, ensuring data integrity and tamper detection.

### Compliance Export
A formatted report of AI activity for regulatory requirements (NIST, EU AI Act, SOC 2, etc.).

---

## D

### Detection
An identified pattern or anomaly in AI traffic, such as PII, prompt injection, or behavioral drift.

### Drift
A change in agent behavior from its established baseline fingerprint. Drift detection helps identify compromised or modified agents.

---

## E

### Enforce
The act of checking policies before allowing an action to proceed. Failed policy checks block the action.

### Evidence Pack
A collection of traces, detections, and metadata packaged for compliance audits.

---

## F

### Fingerprint
See [Agent Fingerprint](#agent-fingerprint).

### Flush
The action of sending batched observations to the TrustScope API. Can be automatic (timer-based) or manual.

---

## G

### Gateway
TrustScope's proxy service that intercepts LLM API calls. Change your base URL to route traffic through the Gateway for automatic monitoring.

### Governance
The policies, procedures, and controls that manage AI agent behavior and ensure compliance.

---

## H

### Hash Chain
A sequence of cryptographic hashes where each trace's hash includes the previous trace's hash, creating a tamper-evident chain.

---

## I

### Ingestion
The process of capturing and recording AI agent activity in TrustScope. Supports multiple methods: Gateway, SDK, API, CLI, and framework callbacks.

---

## J

### Jailbreak
An attempt to bypass an AI model's safety measures or content policies. TrustScope detects and can block jailbreak attempts.

---

## L

### Latency
The time taken for an operation to complete. TrustScope tracks time-to-first-token and total latency for LLM calls.

### Lock (Fingerprint)
The action of saving an agent's current fingerprint as the baseline for drift detection.

---

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A protocol for integrating AI tools with development environments. TrustScope provides an MCP server for Claude Code and Cursor.

### Metrics
Quantitative measurements captured for each trace: tokens, latency, cost, etc.

---

## O

### Observe
The act of logging an action or LLM call to TrustScope without blocking (monitoring mode).

### Observation
A single recorded event in TrustScope, such as an LLM call, tool use, or decision.

---

## P

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
Data that can identify an individual: names, emails, SSNs, etc. TrustScope detects PII and can block or redact it.

### PHI (Protected Health Information)
Health-related data protected under HIPAA. TrustScope detects PHI for healthcare compliance.

### Policy
A rule that governs AI agent behavior. Policies can block, alert, or log based on various conditions.

### Policy Violation
An event where agent activity conflicts with a defined policy. Can result in blocking, alerting, or logging.

### Prompt Injection
An attack where malicious input attempts to override an AI system's instructions. TrustScope detects and blocks injection attempts.

---

## R

### Rate Limit
The maximum number of API requests allowed in a time window. Varies by tier.

### Redaction
The process of removing or masking sensitive data (like PII) from logs while preserving the rest of the trace.

---

## S

### Session
A logical grouping of related traces, typically representing a conversation or workflow.

### System Prompt
The initial instructions given to an LLM that define its behavior and constraints.

---

## T

### Trace
A single recorded event in TrustScope, including input, output, metrics, and metadata. The atomic unit of observability.

### Trace ID
A unique identifier for each trace, formatted as `tr_xxxxx`.

---

## V

### Verification
The process of confirming trace integrity using cryptographic hashes. Ensures traces haven't been tampered with.

---

## W

### Webhook
An HTTP callback that TrustScope sends when events occur (policy violations, detections, etc.).
